So... I spent a while on my old engine called Luna Engine. It was a blast learning a lot with it. But eventually i started to notice a lot of nasty things and desicions i took.
Since then i began my brainstorm on how to actually make a good archetecture for my new engine, so i can learn and support at least 2 graphics APIs and may be 1 more platform.
So i though i might give another try to Nintendo Switch. Started lurking around the web insearch of answers for my main question: How do i develop for Switch?
Since i didn't have an actual console *yet* i found devkitpro for Switch and some Switch emulators. That was my starting point for it.
