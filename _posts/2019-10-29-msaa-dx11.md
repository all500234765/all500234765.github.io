If you just need to read what i've done to fix MSAA go into **LoST** section.

# Story
One day one of my friends send me a message with a two simple sentances:
> Why your screenshots so jittery and aliased?
> Fix it!

Without any arguing that i was lazy for that i chose MSAA for my main AA alghorithm.
I Thought that it would be easy to implement it!
Just add some checks, change some things here add some code here and should be working!

Right?

**Wrong!**

When i started digging i saw how many things must be done in order to enable and use MSAA.
I'll skip a whole story about how i rage each time when i fail to make MSAA work, so bear with me.

Last day i was reading an article written by Turanszkij and i saw a link to his discord server.

This guy helped me a lot and saved a lot of time for future me.

In case you barly see image or can barely read what he wrote:
> @SweetLuna Check the debug layer if it outputs anything when you render to MSAA texture. Also check that you have set a proper sample mask with OMSetBlendState that allows all samples to be written

So thanks to him i finally made MSAA work.

# LoST for MSAA
List of several things that i encountered with when i tried integrating MSAA into my own engine.

0. Check if current device/hardware/software can handle MSAA for this exact DXGI_FORMAT.
    * If yes, then what is max level?
    * If returned Quality > 0 and SampleCount > 1
        * This device/hardware/software supports MSAA for this format with SampleCount levels.

The way how i check for MSAA support can be found [here][4] and [here][5].
    
1. Each RTV that has type of Texture2DMS must have exact RTV but with type of Texture2D.
2. For DSV that has SampleCount > 1 must have:
    * Must have same DSV with No MSAA and No UAV.
    * Must have same DSV with No MSAA, W/ UAV, and without DSV/RTV.
3. Enable MSAA in RasterState.
```cpp
MultisampleEnable = true;
```
4. Set Sample Mask for BlendState to ``0xFFFFFFFF``.
> Mine was always set to 1, and i always wondered why only 1st sample had data, when rest of them - don't?

5. For each RTV MSAA reolve is simple. Just call 
```cpp
ID3D11DeviceContext::ResolveSubresource(ID3D11Resource *Dest, UINT DestSubres, 
                                        ID3D11Resource *Src, UINT SrcSubres, 
                                        DXGI_FORMAT format);
```

6. For depth you do this by hand. I use similar technique as described by [Turanszkij][1] for WikedEngine.
    * Bind no MSAA depth buffer (the one with UAV) to UAV slot for compute shader.
    * Bind original depth buffer with MSAA to SRV slot.
    * Dispatch
* Shader can be found [here][2]
* Depth MSAA resolving function in my RenderTarget class can be found [here][3]

7. Add ``SV_SampleIndex`` for input into rendering shader.
```cpp
GBuffer main(PS In, bool bIsFront : SV_IsFrontFace, uint SampleIndex : SV_SampleIndex) {
```
8. Replace in every shader where you sample original SRV (with MSAA) Texture2D with Texture2DMS.
9. Store for each RTV and DSV(for 3rd one you don't need this) created their SampleCount.
